1. It's nice that you have 'docs' page (https://deepskies.github.io/deeplenstronomy/docs/index.html),
but it would be also cool to have a list of all the names of models/distributions as they should be used in .yaml file
e.g. for 'SHEAR_GAMMA_PSI' for lenstronomy.LensModel.Profiles.shear.ShearGammaPsi(...),
so I don't need to search for it in the lenstronomy github:
https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy/blob/cb4894d2ea1e61fcd5585ae8b618ffdf79c6ea61/lenstronomy/LensModel/profile_list_base.py#L22

2. Readthedocs and some observable scheme (draw.io ?) of yaml file structure would be nice to have.
Such that I can explore all the possible models/arguments/distributions. There is this gh-pages 'guide',
https://deepskies.github.io/deeplenstronomy/Notebooks/ ,but it is more like a reference implementation, rather than something
that you can use on daily basis just to look up some stuff

3. PEMD MASS profile doesn't work. After calling dl.make_dataset(...) jupyter kernel immediately dies.
My configuration: Mac M1,, py 3.9, fortran (https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS/releases/tag/11-arm-alpha2)

4. If you set a parameter (e.g. CONFIGURATION_1-PLANE_2-OBJECT_1-LIGHT_PROFILE_1-center_x-g) with custom distribution,
 then it is worth writing 'center_x:None' in 'Species' instead of random number, so it is obvious that the parameter will be reset.
 Also it is worth adding to the guide (https://deepskies.github.io/deeplenstronomy/Notebooks/UserDistributions.html) that if you use the custom distributions
 the script takes every parameter from the text file and doesn't account for the ones in the 'Species'

 5. Might be worth to add Generalized Normal distribution since it is somewhat softened uniform, so can be useful (e.g.https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.13787.pdf)
 Also Gamma and Beta distributions can be useful since those are conjugate priors to our usual Poisson-based and Normal-based.

6. Typo def euclid(): ... survey='des' ... on this page https://deepskies.github.io/deeplenstronomy/docs/surveys.html

7. If you sample redshifts sometimes source is closer than the deflector (tails of distributions). It would be if the function dl.make_dataset
don't throw error and die, but allow some functionality to handle the case (e.g. ignore this lens and resample it).
I had to put it into loop while ...: try: dl.make_dataset ... except: ...
