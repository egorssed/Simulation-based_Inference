1. It's nice that you have 'docs' page (https://deepskies.github.io/deeplenstronomy/docs/index.html),
but it would be also cool to have a list of all the names of models/distributions as they should be used in .yaml file
e.g. for 'SHEAR_GAMMA_PSI' for lenstronomy.LensModel.Profiles.shear.ShearGammaPsi(...),
so I don't need to search for it in the lenstronomy github:
https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy/blob/cb4894d2ea1e61fcd5585ae8b618ffdf79c6ea61/lenstronomy/LensModel/profile_list_base.py#L22

2. Readthedocs and some observable scheme (draw.io ?) of yaml file structure would be nice to have.
Such that I can explore all the possible models/arguments/distributions. There is this gh-pages 'guide',
https://deepskies.github.io/deeplenstronomy/Notebooks/ ,but it is more like a reference implementation, rather than something
that you can use on daily basis just to look up some stuff

3. PEMD MASS profile doesn't work. After calling dl.make_dataset(...) jupyter kernel immediately dies.
My configuration: Mac M1, py 3.9, fortran (https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS/releases/tag/11-arm-alpha2)
